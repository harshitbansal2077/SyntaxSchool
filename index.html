        <h1>Introduction to Python</h1>
        <article>Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python has gained immense popularity due to its clear syntax, making it an excellent choice for beginners, while also being powerful enough for advanced tasks like data analysis, machine learning, web development, and automation.</article>
        <h2>Why learn Python</h2>
        <ol type="1">
            <li><b>Ease of Learning:</b> Python’s syntax is designed to be intuitive and resembles plain English, which makes it easy to learn and use, especially for those new to programming.</li>
            <li><b>Versatility:</b> Python can be used for a wide range of applications, including web development, data science, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, automation, and more.</li>
            <li><b>Community and Libraries:</b> Python has a large, active community that contributes to its extensive collection of libraries and frameworks. This support makes it easier to find solutions, learn new techniques, and access a wealth of tools that extend Python's capabilities.</li>
            <li><b>Career Opportunities:</b> Python is in high demand across various industries. Learning Python opens up numerous career opportunities in tech, finance, healthcare, and many other fields.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Python Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Readable and Maintainable Code:</b> Python’s focus on readability allows developers to write clean and maintainable code, which is crucial for collaborative projects.</li>
            <li><b>Cross-Platform:</b> Python is cross-platform, meaning it can run on various operating systems such as Windows, macOS, and Linux.</li>
            <li><b>Large Standard Library:</b> Python’s standard library provides modules and packages for many common tasks, from working with files and directories to handling internet protocols and data serialization.</li>
            <li><b>Dynamic Typing:</b> Python supports dynamic typing, which means you don’t need to declare the type of a variable when you create it. This flexibility helps in rapid development and prototyping.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Example of Python Code</h2>
        <p>Here’s a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console:</p>
        <code>
            print("Hello, World!")
        </code>
